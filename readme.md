# Introduction
This web application is a support ticket/helpdesk system designed, implemented and tested by myself, Kyle Macdiarmid.

This application utilises Flask, SQLite and SQLAlchemy, to support development, and is driven by Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

The database is included as a file - website/database.db, and is SQLite so a compatible DB Browser is required to view the data.
